vagrant up
```
‚öôÔ∏è Provisioning

Static network configuration applied to interface eth1.

Wazuh Agent v4.10.1 is downloaded with the following command:
```
wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/pool/main/w/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent_4.10.1-1_amd64.deb
```
If the installation does not start automatically, install it manually:
```
sudo dpkg -i /home/vagrant/wazuh-agent_4.10.1-1_amd64.deb
```
Then configure the agent to point to the Wazuh server by editing:
```
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```
Update the server address in the configuration to:
```
192.168.1.2
